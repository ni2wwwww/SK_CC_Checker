## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All the main settings are located in the **`config.php`** file.

### Authentication

To enable a password prompt for your checker, follow these steps:

1.  **Enable Auth**: In `config.php`, change `$forceAuth` to `true`.
    ```php
    $forceAuth = true; // Set to true to require a password
    ```
2.  **Set Your Password**:
    * Create a temporary PHP file (e.g., `hash_gen.php`) with the following code:
        ```php
        <?php
        echo password_hash('YourNewSecurePassword', PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
        ?>
        ```
    * Run it and copy the resulting hash.
    * Paste the hash into the `$AuthPass_Hashed` variable in `config.php`:
        ```php
        $AuthPass_Hashed = '$2y$10$....your....long....pasted....hash....';
        ```

### Telegram Bot

To receive live results on Telegram:

1.  **Get Your Bot Token**: Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram to create a new bot and get its API token.
2.  **Add Token to Config**: Paste the token into the `$bot_token` variable in `config.php`.
    ```php
    $bot_token = "6188077264:AAFaIbSeHyokvnXQ84eVtnJCGWWBPHHNd2c"; // Replace with your bot's token
    ```
3.  **Get Your Chat ID**: Start a chat with your new bot and then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` (replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual token). Find your chat ID in the response.
4.  **Use in Checker**: Enter this Chat ID in the "Settings" modal of the checker to start receiving notifications.
